# Sauron Pico Library

The [Sauron Pico Library]() provides a library of page layouts and components
to quickly build a web frontend.

The library uses [Sauron](https://github.com/ivanceras/sauron) which is a 
versatile web framework and library for building client-side and server-side web
applications. Components and layouts use [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) as
much as possible.

Pico CSS is a minimal CSS framework that elegantly styles all native HTML
elements without the need for .classes.
